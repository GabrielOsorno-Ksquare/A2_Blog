        <p>Mérida, also known as <em>The White City</em>, is the capital and most populous city of the state of Yucatán, México.
          It is also known for being one of the most pacific and safest areas in the entire country, as well as being one of the most important economic
           and cultural centers in the southeast. Mérida was founded in 1542 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_de_Montejo" target="_blank">Francisco de Montejo y León</a> <em>"el Mozo"</em> and named after the town of Mérida in Extremadura, Spain.
           <br /><br />It was built on the site of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization" target="_blank">mayan</a> city of T'hó, in fact you can see that some carved mayan stones from the original city were used to build numerous buildings
           in downtown; these stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the Cathedral.</p>

        <p>Yucatán is one of the best places to visit if you are looking forward an extraordinary culinary experience.
          <br />One of the most famous dishes is called <em>Pib</em> or <em>Pibipollo</em>. It is kind of a meat pie, the dough is corn-based 
          and it's filled with chicken, tomatoe and x'pelón(black beans); its name comes from pollo(chicken) and piib, the underground oven used 
          in Yucatan, where food is cooked buried in a bed of hot coals and rocks, usually wrapped in banana leaves.
          <br /><br />Other delicious staple dishes are: Cochinita pibil, Escabeche negro, Papak-tsul, Relleno negro and Tamales.

        <p>Mérida is full of intresting places to hang out and have a good time, but some of my favorites are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>La Negrita</strong>. Super classic bar to go drink with friends or family.</li>
          <li><strong>Paseo de Montejo</strong>. Beautiful avenue with lots of restaurants, bars and local artisan stalls.</li>
          <li><strong>El Olimpo</strong>. Cultural center located in the hearth of the city.</li>
          <li><strong>La Plaza Grande</strong>. The townsquare of the city is a nice place to hang out. 
            Late at night the plaza fills with guitarists and interesting characters.</li>
        </ol>
